the freem, incorporated StepMania 5 Theme Porting Project presents
release #001: k//eternal's PROJEKTXV: EPSILON (Originally for 3.9+)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

oh no this theme is legit because it has the k// seal of approval so long as
I credit him, so here's the relevant parts of his readme:
________________________________________________________________________________
LEGAL NOTE
==========
ALL GRAPHICS (excepting character art) HERE ARE LICENSED BY K//ETERNAL. Legal
action is admittedly unlikely, but technically possible. Here's a secret: most of
the time, when people ask me if they can use a graphic or two, I LET THEM (as
long as credit is given). So if you need to borrow something, JUST ASK. DON'T
STEAL.

On the other hand, the code is public domain: if you want to use some or even all
of the code in your own theme, you can do so as long as you don't use any of
the graphics. Credit is unnecessary but appreciated.

Okay that part is over, now I can talk again.

PROJEKTXV for sm-ssc/StepMania 5
a k//eternal theme (http://keternal.pestermom.com/)
ported by AJ of the SSC (http://ssc.ajworld.net/)

Known issues:
* ScreenSelectStyle has issues on player join (Specifically when on Course Single.)
* ModIcons in ScreenOptions don't play nice with Lua option rows, so they're not here.
* There may be some things that are not 100% polished that I didn't get to
  or I might not know about.
* You need to press start on ScreenToggleModels before you can change the option.

Please compare this theme to the 3.9 version
(available at http://keternal.pestermom.com/) and let me know what I'm missing.

AJ wants to thank:
* k//eternal - for making this possible
* Daisuke Master - Ini to Lua saved me so much time on this project.
* Midiman - for creating a sane fallback theme to use as a base for all sm-ssc
themes; this is another reason I was able to save time.
* shakesoda - for being an all-around awesome guy
