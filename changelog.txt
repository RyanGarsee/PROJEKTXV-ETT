PROJEKTXV SM5 port changelog (beta 2 onward)
--------------------------------------------
[r6]
Oh hey.
It's been a while.

If you've had a previous version of the theme, you might notice the last entry in
the changelog has been edited. That's because I'm running Windows 7 and compiling
StepMania to use DirectX 9, so the first complaint isn't really valid anymore.

This is the first version of the theme developed under the new error reporting
system that Kyzentun put into StepMania 5 some time after beta 3's release.

* Added missing "Graphics/ScreenTextEntry header".
* Remove really old Lua scoring thing that's no longer used.
* Changed particle zoom implementation; thanks to Kyzentun for pointing out the problem.
* Fixed a bug on Course select where course time would not be accurate.
* Fixed a bug on ScreenStageInformation in Course mode.
* Fixed a bug with ScreenGameplay TimeDisplay in Course mode.

[r5]
Okay I had to come back from the dead to do this.

Just one note about this commit:
https://code.google.com/p/stepmania/source/detail?r=6126dbc1b6a115c76a85d09c8d2028f1b67cecee&path=/Themes/_fallback/metrics.ini
I only have the following to say. http://oi25.tinypic.com/288ay5x.jpg

Alright, enough ranting, time to get to the actual changes in this version.
* Fixed crash caused by the change of the Remove item from Options.
* Added missing frame to bottom of ScreenEvaluation.

Unless any other serious errors come up, this is probably the last update.
